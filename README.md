# Dark Souls Death Counter (fork of Quidrex/DSDeaths)

More information coming soon...

(Original README)

## What is this and what is it good for?

This is a Dark Souls death counter. It keeps reading your current death count from RAM while Dark Souls is running and writes it to a file when it changes. A sample use case is displaying your death count on stream as both OBS Classic and OBS Studio support reading a text source from a file.

Side Note: The death count is not reset when you defeat Gwyn and enter NG+.

## Which games does it support?

 * DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition
 * DARK SOULS II: Scholar of the First Sin
 * DARK SOULS III
 * DARK SOULS: REMASTERED

 Note that only the current patch as of the time of release works. Please open a ticket if there is a new patch and it stops functioning.

## How do I use it?

Just double click it. It writes the current death count into `DSDeaths.txt` in the current directory. I died 779 times in my first playthrough of the original Dark Souls.
